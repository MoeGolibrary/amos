# amos

Amos is a decentralized state manager for `React`, inspired by `Redux`, `Vuex` and `Recoil`.

## Highlights

- **ðŸ˜˜ Decentralized**, no `rootReducer` or `combineReducers`, state is registered automatically
- **ðŸ¥° High performance**, many outstanding performance optimizations, especially with
  [cached selectors](#selector-caches) and [transactions](#transactions)
- **ðŸ¥³ Out of the box**, no `plugins`, no `middlewares`, no `toolkits`, and no `xxx-react`

And more:

- **Strong typed**, all the API has explicit params and return types with TypeScript
- **Lightweight**, the package size is less than `3kb` after gzip, and
  [Tree-shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking) friendly
- **Complete**, supports [server-side rendering(SSR)](#server-side-renderingssr),
  [hooks](#with-hooks) and [class components](#with-class-components)
- **Easy to use**
  - The core concepts and API is similar to `Redux`
  - Easy to hybrid with redux: [`amos-redux`](https://github.com/acrazing/amos-redux)
  - Works with `redux-devtools` for development: [`amos-redux-devtools`](https://github.com/acrazing/amos-redux-devtools)

**WARNING: THE API IS DESIGNING**

## Installation

```bash
yarn add amos

## Concepts

### Store

A `store` is an isolated world, everything will only happen in one store,
and there will be no correlation between different stores. You can create
a `store` by calling [`createStore()`](#createstore):

```typescript
import { createStore } from 'amos';

const store = createStore();
```

The function `createStore` accepts one optional parameter `preloadedState`.
If your project uses server-side rendering(SSR), or has other pre-loaded
states, you can call this function like this:

```typescript
const store = createStore(somePreloadedState);
```

This is different from redux, you don't need to pass in a `reducer`, which
is the main culprit for centralizing redux. Centralization makes redux very
difficult to manage in large projects.

The `store` provides two primary methods: the first one is `dispatch`,
which is used to modify the state of the `store`, and the other is
`select`, which is used to select the state of the `store`.

We need to create a simple [`box`](#box) and [`mutation`](#mutation) to
demonstrate this feature. Don't worry, it's just two very simple line of code,
and you can get the full picture of the `box` and `mutation` in the
[following document](#box).

Now, we will create the `box` at first:

```typescript
import { box, identity } from 'amos';

const countBox = box('count', 0, identity);
```

In the above code, we created a `box` called `countBox`, its initial state is
the number `0`. And then, we need to create a `mutation` to mutate it:

```typescript
import { mutation } from 'amos';

const increment = mutation(countBox, (state) => state + 1);
```

As you can see, we created a `mutation` called `increment`, it will mutate
`countBox`'s state, let it add `1`.

Now we begin to show how to select and mutate the state of `countBox`, it
is very simple:

```typescript
const originalCount = store.select(countBox);
store.dispatch(increment());
const updatedCount = store.select(countBox);
console.log([originalCount, updatedCount]));
```

The first line of the above code selects the state of `countBox`, it should be
the initial state of `countBox`, which is `0`. In the second line, we dispatched
a mutation `increment` to mutate `countBox`, it should add `countBox` state to `1`.
So, the result of the above code will print `[0, 1]` in console.

### Boxes

A `box` is a container to keep some metadata of a state node, such as the
key in store, and initial state of the box, etc. The `box` is the key object
to associate `store` and `mutations`, `selectors` and `signals`. You can use
[`box()`](#box) to create a `box`:

```typescript
import { box, identity } from 'box';

export const countBox = box('count', 0, identity);
```

As you can see, you have seen these lines of code in the [`Store`](#store)
section. We will explain this function in detail here.

The first parameter is the `key` of the `box`, it **MUST** be a string and
unique in your project's boxes, it is used internally, so it can be a string
in any format, the only thing you should care about is **KEEP IT UNIQUE**.

The second one is the initial state of the box, please note it is **NOT** a
factory to create initial state, because the state **SHOULD BE IMMUTABLE**.

And the last one parameter is `preload`, which is used for transform preloaded
state to its state. We need this parameter because sometimes state is different
to preloaded state. For example, if a box's state is a `Immutable.js`'s `Record`,
and use `JSON` to serialize it, you can use this method to convert it:

```typescript
import { box } from 'box';
import { Record } from 'immutable';

class UserState extends Record({
  firstName: '',
  lastName: '',
}) {}

export const userBox = box('user', new UserState(), (preloadedState, state) => {
  return state.merge(preloadedState);
});
```

As you can see, the `preload` function accepts two parameters `preloadedState` and
`state`, and returns the transformed state. If your state is pure object, does not
need transform, you can use `identity` to use `preloadedState` directly, which is
provided by `amos` as the `countBox` created above.

In most cases, you only need to use the box itself, without paying attention to the
methods or properties it provides, except when you need to subscribe to [signals](#signals).

### Mutations

A `Mutation` is an object which will mutate a `box`'s state when it is dispatched.

You can create a `MutationFactory` by calling [`mutation()`](#mutation):

```typescript
import { mutation } from 'amos';
export const addCount = mutation(countBox, (state, delta: number) => state + delta);
const result = store.dispatch(addCount(1));
```

The [`mutation()`](#mutation) function accepts two parameters called `box` and `mutator`,
and returns a `MutationFactory`. The `box` is a box defined by calling [`box()`](#boxes),
such as `countBox` upon. And the `mutator` is a function accepts two parameters called
`state` and `action`, and returns the mutated new state of the `box`. The
`MutationFactory` is a function accepts one optional parameter called `action` and
returns a `Mutation`.

The `Mutation` is dispatchable, which means you can use it as the parameter of
[`store.dispatch()`](#storedispatch). When it is dispatched, the following things will
happen:

- the `mutator` will be called with two parameters which are the state of the `box` and
  the parameter passed in when the `MutationFactory` is called.
- the state of the `box` will be set as the return value of the `mutator`.
- the return value of the `store.dispatch()` will be the parameter passed in when the
  `MutationFactory` is called.

In the code above, we created a `MutataionFactory` called `addCount`, which will add
the state of the `countBox` with `delta`. And dispatched `addCount` with `delta` equals
to `1`. The value of `result` should be `1`.

### Actions

An `action` is an object which will do something asynchronous or synchronous, and
dispatch some `Mutations`, `Signals`, other `Actions` when it is dispatched.

You can create an `ActionFactory` by calling [`action()`](#action):

```typescript
import { action } from 'amos';

declare function myDBSetCount(count: number): Promise<void>;

export const addCountAsync = action((dispatch, select, delta: number) => {
  const count = select(countBox);
  return myDBSetCount(count + delta).then(() => dispatch(addCount(delta)));
});

const result = await store.dispatch(addCountAsync(2));
```

The [`action()`](#action) accepts one parameter called `actor`, and returns an
`ActionFactory`. The `actor` is a function which will be called when you dispatch
the `Action`. The `ActionFactory` is a function, which will return an `Action`.

The `Action` is dispatchable, when you dispatch it, the `actor` will be called
with the following parameters: `dispatch`, `select` and the parameters passed in
when the `ActionFactory` is called. The `dispatch` and `select` are the
[`store.dispatch`](#storedispatch) and [`store.select`](#storeselect), which
allow you to dispatch some dispatchable things and select states. The return
value of `store.dispatch(action)` is the return value of `actor`.

### Signals

A `SignalFactory` is a function to create an `Signal`, and could be subscribed by
a `box`. A `Signal` is an object, which will trigger the subscribed `boxes`
to mutate these states when you dispatch it.

You can create a `SignalFactory` by calling [`signal()`](#signal), and subscribe its
`Signals` by calling [`box.subscribe()`](#boxsubscribe):

```typescript
import { signal } from 'amos';

export const reset = signal((count: number) => ({ count }));

countBox.subscribe(reset, (state, data) => data.count);

store.select(countBox);

store.dispatch(reset(1));
```

The function [`signal()`](#signal) accepts one optional parameter called `creator` and
returns a `SignalFactory`. The `creator` is an optional function, which is called when
you call `SignalFactory`, its return value will be used as the second parameter of the
subscribers and the return value of [`store.dispatch()`](#storedispatch) when you
dispatch it.

**Please note that a signal will only be dispatched to the boxes which is invoked
already(`select(box)` and `dispatch(mutation)` will invoke the relative `box`
automatically).**

### Selectors

`Store` provides an api called [`select`](#storeselect), which allows you to select
a `box`'s state or execute a `selector`. For example: you can get a box's state like
this:

```typescript
const count = store.select(countBox);
```

A `selector` is a function, which accepts one parameter `select`, which is the
[`store.select`](#storeselect), you can use the parameter to select a box or another
`selectors`. For example:

```typescript
import { Select } from 'amos';

const selectDoubleCount = (select: Select) => select(countBox) * 2;

const doubleCount = store.select(selectDoubleCount);
```

In this case, the `selectDoubleCount` select the state of `countBox`, and returns its
double value.

Sometimes, a `selector` dependents on some external parameters. If you want to
provide a public selector for your `box`'s users, you may write some codes like this:

```typescript
import { Select } from 'amos';

export const selectMultipleCount = (multiplier: number) => {
  return (select: Select) => select(countBox) * multiplier;
};

const tripleCount = store.select(selectMultipleCount(3));
```

That seems a bit complicated, but don't worry, we provide a function
[`selector()`](#selector) to help you create a curried selector, and it
brings more additional benefits. For example:

```typescript
import { selector } from 'amos';

const selectMultipleCount = selector((select, multiplier: number) => {
  return select(countBox) * multiplier;
});

const tripleCount = store.select(selectMultipleCount(3));
```

As you can see, the [`selector()`](#selector) function accepts one parameter
to select a value, which accepts a `select` and one or more parameters which
is passed in when the returned function is called.

In addition, the [`selector()`](#selector) accepts another parameter called
`deps`, which allows you to cache the result of the selector. You can get
more information at [#Selector caches](#selector-caches).

## React integration

First of all, whether you use `hooks` or `class components`, you need to use
[`<Provider />`](#provider-) outside these components to inject the `store`
to create the world. The best way is to put the `<Provider />` in your root
component. For example:

```typescript jsx
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { createStore, Provider } from 'amos';

const store = createStore();

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <MyApp />
  </Provider>,
  document.querySelector('#root'),
);
```

### With react hooks

With react hooks, you can use [`useSelector()`](#useselector)
to select states and use `useDispatch()` to get the
[`store.dispatch()`](#storedispatch) to dispatch a dispatchable thing.

For example:

```typescript jsx
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'amos';

function Count() {
  const dispatch = useDispatch();
  const [count, doubleCount, trippleCount] = useSelector(
    countBox,
    selectDoubleCount,
    selectMultipleCount(3),
  );
  const handleAdd = () => dispatch(increment());
  return (
    <div>
      <span>Click count: {count}</span>
      <span>Click count double: {doubleCount}</span>
      <span>Click count tripple: {trippleCount}</span>
      <button onClick={handleAdd}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

As you can see, [`useDispatch()`](#usedispatch) just returns the
[`store.dispatch`](#storedispatch). And [`useSelector()`](#useselector)
accepts multiple `Selector` or `Box`, it returns an array of the
parameters select result.

### With class components

With class components, you can use [`connect()`](#connect) to create
a high order component(HOC) with the state injected to the component.

`connect` accepts one optional parameter called `mapProps`, and returns
a function called `Connector`. The `mapProps` is a function that maps
the selected state to the props. The `Connector` accepts a `ComponentType`
object, and returns a new `ComponentType`.

`Connect` and `react-redux`'s `connect` are basically the same, but we
simplified some of its features. Specifically, they have these differences:

1. It always injects `dispatch` to the HOC.
2. It does not support `mapActions`.
3. The `mapProps`'s first parameter is [`store.select`](#storeselect)
   rather than the state.
4. It will not copy static props from the wrapped component to the new component.

For example:

```typescript jsx
import { PureComponent } from 'react';
import { connect, ConnectedProps } from 'amos';

export interface CouuntProps extends ConnectedProps {
  count: number;
}

export class Count extends PureComponent<CountProps> {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <span>Click count: {this.props.count}</span>
        <button onClick={() => this.props.dispatch(increment())}>Click me</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export const ConnectedCount = connect((select) => ({
  count: select(countBox),
}))(Count);
```

Please note that `connect` cannot use as decorator with typescript for the reason
of the ECMAScript specification. The following code is ok with `babel`, but will
emit some type errors with `TypeScript`:

```typescript jsx
import { connect } from 'amos';

@connect()
class SomeComponent extends Component {
  // ...
}
```

If you want to do this, you can create your own connector with some extra code:

```typescript jsx
import { connect, Select } from 'amos';

export function myConnect(
  mapper?: (select: Select, ownedProps: unknown) => unknown,
): ClassDecorator {
  return connect(mapper) as any;
}

@myConnect()
export class SomeComponent extends Component {
  // ...
}
```

## Receipts

### Transactions

Every call of [`store.dispatch(dispatchable)`](#storedispatch) will notify all
the subscribers which are registered by [`store.subscribe()`](#storesubscribe).
Which means if you call `store.dispatch` twice synchronously, the subscribers
will be called twice yet. Something will make the thing different:

1. call `store.dispatch` with a `dispatchable` array:

   ```typescript jsx
   store.dispatch([increment(), increment()]);
   ```

2. dispatch `dispatchables` in an `action` **synchronous**:

   ```typescript jsx
   const incrementTwice = action((dispatch) => {
     dispatch(increment());
     dispatch(increment());
   });

   store.dispatch(incrementTwice());
   ```

Both of the two actions will only notice the subscribers once. **Please
note the `2nd` one needs to be `synchronous`, which means the
asynchronous dispatches are separated, you MUST call the `dispatch()`
in the `1th` form in your asynchronous actions.** For example:

```typescript jsx
const exampleAction = action(async (dispatch) => {
  dispatch(actionA());
  dispatch(mutationB());
  dispatch(signalC());
  // the upon three dispatches are in one transaction

  await doSomething();
  dispatch(actionD());
  dispatch(mutationE());
  dispatch(signalF());
  // the upon three dispatches are three separate transaction

  dispatch([actionG(), mutationH(), signalI()]);
  // the upon dispatch will dispatch the three dispatchable in a transaction
});
```

### Selector caches

When you use [`useSelector`](#useselector) in your component, the component
should update if the state of boxes updated. the `useSelector` will caches
the last parameters and state snapshots and the result of it. If a `dispatch`
mutated the state which is not depended by the selectors, the component will
not rerender. It is fantastic!

Consider you have a component as follow:

```typescript jsx
import { memo } from 'react';
const MultipleCount = memo<{ multipler: number }>(({ multiper }) => {
  const [count] = useSelector(selectMultipleCount(multipler));
  return (
    <div>
      Click count * {multipler}: {count}
    </div>
  );
});
```

And it is used multiple times in a component:

```typescript jsx
function ShowCount() {
  return (
    <div>
      <MultipleCount multipler={1} />
      <MultipleCount multipler={2} />
      <MultipleCount multipler={3} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

TODO

In addition, [`selector()`](#selector) accepts the second parameter called `deps`,
which is a function also. The `deps` should accepts parameters same to the `fn`, and
returns an array as the cache key, it will be called in `useSelector` to check if the
selector should be rerun. For example:

```typescript jsx
const selectFactorialCount = selector(
  (select) => factorial(select(countBox)),
  (select) => [select(countBox)],
);
```

The selector will not be recomputed if the `countBox`'s state is not changed.

### Server side rendering(SSR)

In server-side, `store` provides a method [`store.snapshot()`](#storesnapshot)
allows you to get all states allocated in the store, and you can print it
to your HTML page as follow:

```typescript jsx
const store = createStore();
await store.dispatch(something);
const html = `<script>var __INITIAL_STATE__ = ${JSON.stringify(store.snapshot()).replace(
  /</g,
  '\\u003c',
)}</script>`;
```

In client side, you can read it as the preloaded state to create the store:

```typescript jsx
const store = createStore(__INITIAL_STATE__);
```
