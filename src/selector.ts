 *             the state of the boxes that the selector depends on. If these
 *             states and the parameters of the selector have not changed, then
 *             the selector will not be recomputed. On the contrary, if you
 *             specify the deps function, then if the return value of this
 *             function does not change, the selector will not be executed. In
 *             most cases, you donâ€™t need to specify the deps function, but if
 *             the state of a box that a selector depends on has attributes that
 *             are easy to update and are not dependent on this selector, and
 *             the execution of this selector takes a long time, then you can
 *             specify the deps function. In addition, if you set deps function
 *             as `false`, the selector will always be recomputed, ignores the
 *             args and dependents states.
 * @param compare the compare function, determines the selected result is
 *                updated or not, if it returns true, the component will
 *                rerender. The default compare function is strict equal (`===`).
 * @param type the optional type for display in react devtools
 *
